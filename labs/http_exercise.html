      <h2>1. What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application-level protocol, which is
        used to fetch the resources such as HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).
        It was designed with the purpose of communication between web browsers
        and web servers along with various other purposes. It tends to follow a
        classical client-server model, whereby a client sends in a request and
        waits for a response from the server.

      <h2>2. Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?</h2>
      <p>
        HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that the connection between
        the browser and the server is lost once the transaction ends.

        3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using
        client-server protocols such as HTTP.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The three phases of client-server protocols such as HTTP are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection
          if the transport layer is not TCP).
        </li>
        <li>The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.</li>
        <li>
          The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a
          status code and appropriate data.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>4. Describe the parameters of on a get and post request.</h2>
      <p>
        Both the GET and POST methods are transformer of data, which means that
        they transfer data from the client to server in HTTP protocol, but the
        GET appends the returning variables and thier values to the URL string,
        whereas POST does not. POST intends for changing the server state, which
        carries more data.

        5. What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status
        codes 200 and 404 indicate?
      </h2>
      <p>
        HTTP response status codes determine whether a specific HTTP request has
        been successfully completed. <br />
        The HTTP <strong>200 OK</strong> success status code specifies - the
        request has succeeded. A 200 response is cacheable by defualt. <br />
        A success depends on the HTTP request method, here are the 4 of them:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>GET:</strong>&nbsp;The resource has been fetched and is
          transmitted in the message body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>HEAD:</strong>&nbsp;The representation headers are included in
          the response without any message body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>POST:</strong>&nbsp;The resource describing the result of the
          action is transmitted in the message body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>TRACE:</strong>&nbsp;The message body contains the reqeust
          message as received by the server.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The HTTP <strong>404 NOT FOUND</strong>&nbsp;client error response code
        specifies - the server cannot find the requested resource.

      <h2>6. What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</h2>
      <p>
        The HTTP cookies are text files with small chunks of data - a server
        sends to the user's web browser, which includes username and password
        and are used to identify specific users and enhance users web browsing
        experience.

      <h2>7. Why are cookies a security issue?</h2>
      <p>
        Any personal information - users give to a website, including credit
        card information, will most likely to be stored in a cookie until the
        users turned off the cookie feature in their browser. The cookies are
        visible and can be changed by any end-user.

      <h2>8. Describe session hijacking and XSS.</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Session Hijacking:</strong>&nbsp;It is an attack where a user
        session is taken over by an attacker. A session begins when the user log
        into a service, such as user's banking application and ends when user
        log out. It happens when an attacker knows the victim's session ID
        (session key). This can be acheived by stealing the session cookie or
        persuading the user to click a malicious link containing a prepared
        session ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cros-site scripting (XSS):</strong>&nbsp;XSS is probably the
        most hazardous and widespread technique of web session hijacking. By
        exploiting server or application vulnerabilities, attackers can inject
        client-side script (typically JavaScript) into web pages, causing user's
        browser to execute arbitrary code when it loads a compromised page.

      <h2>9. Describe Cros-site request forgery (CSRF).</h2>
      <p>
        Cros-site request forgery (CSRF) is an attack vector - tricks a web
        browser into executing an unwanted action in an application to which a
        user is logged in. A successfull CSRF attack devastates both of the
        business and user, which can consequentially in damaged client
        relationships, unauthorised fund transfers, changed passwords and data
        theft - including stolen session cookies.

      <h2>
        10. What are Cros-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?
      </h2>
      <p>
        CORS is an HTTP header based structure - allows a server to specify any
        other origins than its own from which a browser should permit loading of
        resources. The CORS tool supports secure cross-origin reqeusts and data
        transfers between browsers and servers. The browsers use CORS in APIs
        such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch to mitigate the risks of cross-origin
        HTTP requests. For instance, an HTML page from Domain A
        (http://domaina.example/) makes a request for an image on Domain B
        (http://domainb.foo/image.jpg) via the img element.
